# Face-tracking-using-opencv-ardrino

**Face Detection and Tracking**
This repository implements a real-time face detection and tracking system leveraging OpenCV and Arduino. The system operates as follows:

Video Capture: A webcam is employed to capture video frames at a specified frame rate.
Face Detection: A Haar Cascade classifier is utilized to identify human faces within each captured frame.
Coordinate Extraction: The precise coordinates of the detected face are extracted from the frame.
Serial Communication: The extracted coordinates are transmitted to an Arduino board via serial communication.
Servo Motor Control: The Arduino board processes the received coordinates and controls servo motors to orient a camera or display in the direction of the detected face.
Key Features

Real-time Face Detection: Efficiently detects faces in live video streams.
Accurate Coordinate Extraction: Provides precise facial coordinates for precise tracking.
Reliable Serial Communication: Ensures robust data transfer between the computer and Arduino.
Precise Servo Motor Control: Enables accurate tracking of the detected face.
Modular Design: Facilitates easy customization and integration with other systems.
Potential Applications

Security Systems: Monitor and track individuals in specific areas.
Smart Home Automation: Control devices based on facial recognition.
Robotics: Enable robots to interact with humans more naturally.
Augmented Reality: Overlay digital content onto real-world objects based on facial features.
Future Enhancements

Deep Learning-Based Detection: Explore advanced deep learning models for improved accuracy and robustness.
Multiple Face Tracking: Handle multiple faces in a single frame.
Facial Recognition: Implement facial recognition capabilities for personalized interactions.
Wireless Communication: Utilize wireless communication protocols for greater flexibility and range.
